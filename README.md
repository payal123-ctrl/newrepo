Geo-Intelligent Vehicle Accident Alert System

Overview:

The Geo-Intelligent Vehicle Accident Alert System is a real-time emergency notification system designed to detect vehicle accidents and automatically alert emergency services and pre-configured contacts. The system uses a combination of hardware and cloud technologies, including an STM32 microcontroller, GPS module, ESP32 Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module, and cloud services to ensure accurate location tracking and efficient alerting.

When a vehicle accident is detected (e.g., through sudden impact), the system sends the real-time location data along with an accident alert to emergency services and configured contacts. This reduces response time, improves road safety, and can potentially save lives.
